# Pass Gate

A GUI application for Mac and Linux which aims to provide a set of operations for handling user secrets.

## Motivation

Handling dozens of secrets in a secure and convenient way may represent quite a challenge nowadays.
This application is another approach to ease this difficulty while pursuing strong cryptographical standards.
The design goal of this utility is to provide a set of common operations that can be combined to get the desired result.

## Features

The following futures are supported:

* Generate a secret according to the specified format
* Generate a keyfile
* Generate a BIP39 mnemonic
* Encrypt / decrypt a secret (AES GCM)
* Split / recombine a secret according to the Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme (011B over GF(256))
* Type the password into a password field (Linux only)
* Split the secret into parts of the same size during the view process
* Clear clipboard upon exit

The utility may use one of the following entropy sources for performing cryptographic operations:

* Random Number Generator (PKCS11 or OpenSSL)
* RSA Signature (PKCS 11, PKCS 12, PKCS 8) with HKDF-SHA-512
* BIP39 mnemonic

## Dependencies

* [Qt5](https://www.qt.io)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
* [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool)
